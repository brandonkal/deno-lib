# Deno lib

A large collection of useful Typescript libraries for Deno.
Each utility is provided in its own file at the root.

This monorepo also includes a few related npm modules to make working with Deno better.

## Usage

Check the license information for the functionality you want. If permitted, import the functions you need.

```ts
import * as yamlTag from 'https://x.kite.run/lib/yaml-tag.ts'
```

This library used to be available at `deno.land/x/lib`.
After the Deno team decided to break import URLs, the canonical import domain came into being.

<!--Included Utilites section is generated by doc-gen.ts and cleaned up by hand-->

## Included Utilities

### args.ts

Utilities for parsing CLI arguments.

### dedent.ts

Dedent is a tagged template literal function.
It is used by yaml-tag.ts and has tests to ensure consistency with a whitespace-sensitive content.

### doc-gen.ts

Parse File-level JSDoc from a folder of TS/JS files for document generation.

### go.ts

Simplified async error handling in TypeScript.

### http-cache-semantics.ts

Parses Cache-Control and other headers. Helps building correct HTTP caches and proxies. Ported from the npm package by the same name.

### kite.ts

Kite™️ is a Simplified Config Generation Library.

Ground Rules:

1. No async code. Ever.
2. No console.log
3. post-processors cannot generate new objects
4. Everything is a function. Export it as default and optionally call make() if import.meta.main
5. Contract: All module functions should be a function that accepts or ignores one object argument.
6. make() should always be in scope for all config gen modules.

### kubernetes.ts

Kubernetes Config Generation Library
Refer to kite.ts for more info.

### kx.ts

kx is a simplified Kubernetes Config SDK for Kite.

### magic-string.js

Manipulate strings like a wizard.

NOTE: This is the ES bundle with the sourcemap-codec import corrected.
Source is available at
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/magic-string@0.25.6/dist/magic-string.es.js

### merge.ts

Provides generic object merging functions. Useful for config generation.

### proxymise.ts

Chainable Promise Proxy utility. Proxymise allows for method and property chaining without need for intermediate then() or await for cleaner and simpler code.

### quokka-shim.ts

A shim for test functions when running Deno code.
Consider using @brandonkal/deno-quokka and babel-plugin-deno npm packages for a more robust debugging experience.

### resolve-object

Recursively resolve any promises in an object to form a resulting JSON structure.

### resolve-promise-object.ts

Recursively resolve any promises in an object to form a resulting JSON structure.

### runtypes.ts

A Deno port of the great RunTypes library. Use TypeScript in the runtime.

Port introduces loose conversion. This means a check() call may modifies if required.

- Primitives should be assigned to themselves.
- "false" | "true" > boolean
- "null" > null
- "42" > 42
- See https://github.com/brandonkal/runtypes

### sourcemap-codec.ts

Encode/decode sourcemap mappings

### unraw.ts

Undo `String.raw`.

Convert raw escape sequences to their respective characters

### utils.ts

A collection of useful small functions in one location.

### yaml-formatter.ts

Parses YAML or JSON input and prints out YAML documents with a stable object sort. Ideal for converting JSON to YAML. Useful as a lightweight CLI or as a formatting function.

### yaml-tag.ts

Write YAML within TypeScript programs for cleaner and more concise code.

This module provides the following exports:

- y (yaml text tagged template function)
- printYaml (JS Object Array to YAML multi-document text)

## Others

### @brandonkal/deno-quokka

This npm module provides basic Quokka.js support for executing Deno files. This helps speed up development of Deno libraries such as `yaml-tag.ts`.

### babel-plugin-deno

This npm module rewrites imports to use the cache directory.

It can be used in combination with `@brandonkal/deno-quokka` for an interactive REPL for some Deno-flavored TypeScript code.

### npm/register.js

Debug a Deno program via Node.

## License

© 2020 Brandon Kalinowski (@brandonkal). All rights reserved.

Not all files are released under a permissive open source license (though many are).
In particular, the modules in the `kite` directory do not carry an open-source license.

See individual file headers for license information.
Files without headers are © Brandon Kalinowski (@brandonkal). All rights reserved.

If a file contains no specified license, no license has been provided.

### Why

It's simple really. Each module in this repository could have been released in its own repository.
In the npm world, that would mean a seperate _package_. Each of those would contain their own license.
With Deno, files are modules. The file is the distributed content. There is no "minification" step.
Therefore, it is smarter to specify license information inside the files.
It would be silly to provide a blanket license over the entire repository contents as that would require that a single license would apply to _all files_.

This approach also makes automation of license compliance simpler. The rules above are simple. You can use `doc-gen.ts` or another JSDoc parser to scan the file's structured header block for all your imports.
